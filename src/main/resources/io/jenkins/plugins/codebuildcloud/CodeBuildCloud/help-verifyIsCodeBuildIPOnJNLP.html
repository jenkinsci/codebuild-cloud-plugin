  Some people might want to run Jenkins publicly and make sure only desired Agents can connect to this Controller. To
  enable more security than what has already been enabled natively with the Jenkins Agent JNLP, this setting verifies
  the connecting IP address is owned by Amazon and part of the CodeBuild Service IP addresses. We only include Amazon
  specific IPs and CodeBuild service IPs. This enables Jenkins's TCP Listener to be more open from a firewall
  perspective, but more locked down from an Application perspective.
  <hr />
  If you enable this setting and are using JNLP, you will need to make sure when agents connect, that the source IP is
  AWS CodeBuild. That means if you have configured your build to use VPC subnets where the Controller is, you should NOT
  check this setting. This setting should only be used when you can guarantee the IP address the CodeBuild agent is
  trying to connect from, is from the public facing CodeBuild IP addresses. (This includes if using a load balancer make
